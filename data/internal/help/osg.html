  <h2>Open Scene Graph</h2>
The OpenSceneGraph is an open source high performance 3D graphics toolkit, 
used by application developers in fields such as visual simulation, 
games, virtual reality, scientific visualization and modelling. Written 
entirely in Standard C++ and OpenGL it runs on all Windows platforms, 
OSX, GNU/Linux, IRIX, Solaris, HP-Ux, AIX and FreeBSD operating systems.
 The OpenSceneGraph is now well established as the world leading scene 
graph technology, used widely in the vis-sim, space, scientific, 
oil-gas, games and virtual reality industries.</p>
<p>Supports view-frustum culling, 
occlusion culling, small feature culling, Level Of Detail (LOD) nodes, 
OpenGL state sorting, vertex arrays, vertex buffer objects, OpenGL 
Shader Language and display lists as part of the core scene graph. These
 together make the OpenSceneGraph one of the highest performance 
graphics toolkit available. The OpenSceneGraph also supports easy 
customization of the drawing process, such as implementation of 
Continuous Level of Detail (CLOD) meshes on top of the scene graph (see 
Virtual Terrain Project and Delta3D).</p>
