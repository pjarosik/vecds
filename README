To compile vecds:

$ cd CMakeBuild
$ cmake ..
$ make

Note, by default vecds will compile in debug mode. To change that to
release (optimized) mode, try:

$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

To run vecds:

$ cd bin
$ ./vecds


Known bugs: 

	** The tiled window manager (i3-wm) looses connection with the
           graphics somehow when operating in portait mode; I have no
           clue what does this. (TDY 2012/05/29).
