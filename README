To compile vecds:

$ cd CMakeBuild
$ cmake ..
$ make

Note, by default vecds will compile in debug mode. To change that to
release (optimized) mode, try:

$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

To run vecds with a GUI, go to the bin directory and run:

$ cd bin
$ ./vecds

To "distclean" vecds, just remove everything in the CMakeBuild
directory.

$ cd CMakeBuild
$ rm -rf ./*
