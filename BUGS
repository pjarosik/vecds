These are some known bugs in vecds that should be fixed. A brief
desciption is given, and the reporter and fixer.

Known bugs: 

	** Saving data does not support a file browser correctly. (TDY
           2012/05/31).

	** Tiled window managers (i3wm, at least) looses connection
           with the graphics somehow when operating in portait mode; I
           have no clue what does this. (TDY 2012/05/29).

	** The help browser was abusing memory by creating multiple
           copies of itself and not destroying them. This has been
           fixed. (TDY 2012/05/05). Fixed. (TDY 2012/05/20)

	** Several vecds classes were missing explicit destructors;
           this is causing wierd untrackable behaviour. (TDY
           2012/05/05) Fixed. (TDY, JC 2012/05/21).
