v 0.4.* 2012/05/16
------------------

Improvments:

	** The menu logic has been changed and the code generating it
           is now more descriptive. (TDY 2012/05/29).

	** The code that makes up vecds has been put in its own
           "namespace vecds". (TDY 2012/05/25).

	** A standard directory structure has been initiated on the
           source code. Examples, settings, and the vecds
           documentation are put in a platform independent
           location. (TDY 2012/05/21).

	** Using qmake to build vecds was always a bit
           simplistic. Now, vecds can be configured and installed on
           almost any system (untested) using cmake. (TDY 2012/05/18).

Bug fixes:

	** Several vecds classes were missing explicit destructors,
           this has been fixed. (TDY, JC 2012/05/21).

	** The help browser was abusing memory by creating multiple
           copies of itself and not destroying them. This has been
           fixed. (TDY 2012/05/20).

v 0.3.* 2012/05/16
------------------

Improvements:

	** First official buggy release. (TDY 2012/05/16).
