v 0.4.* 2012/05/16
------------------

Improvements:

	** Using qmake to build vecds was always a bit
           simplistic. Now, vecds can be configured and installed on
           almost any system (untested) using cmake. (TDY 2012/05/18).

GUI:

	** TODO: The help browser never actually worked due to
           built-in directory structure. (TDY ????/??/??).

Bug fixes:

	** The help browser was abusing memory by creating multiple
           copies of itself and not destroying them. This has been
           fixed. (TDY 2012/05/20).

v 0.3.* 2012/05/16
------------------

Improvements:

	** First official buggy release. (TDY 2012/05/16).
